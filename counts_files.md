## Counts files for performing Differential Expression (DE) analysis. 

These files contain organized counts data, calculated as RSEM estimated counts via the [TOIL](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?host=https://toil.xenahubs.net) pipeline. The original, 'raw' processed counts data are hosted at [Xena](xena.ucsc.edu)
